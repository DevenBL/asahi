As some will be aware, WirePlumber 0.5.0 introduced a significant breaking change
to its entire configuration system, eliminating the use of Lua scripts for
basic config-like actions. This also came with a complete rework of how Lua scripts
are registered with WirePlumber for execution.

ANY CUSTOM FUNCTIONALITY WHICH RELIES ON WIREPLUMBER'S LUA API WILL BREAK ON UPGRADE

If you rely on this functionality, please review the WirePlumber documentation on
porting your Lua scripts to the new API and registering them with the system:

https://pipewire.pages.freedesktop.org/wireplumber/daemon/configuration/migration.html

Most typical desktop users, including EasyEffects users, should experience no regressions
as a result of this. If for any reason you do, or if you encounter a dependency conflict
when upgrading your system, please open an issue on the overlay:

https://github.com/chadmed/asahi-overlay/issues

We are deploying this to ::asahi as a canary for wider deployment to ::gentoo simply
because media-libs/asahi-audio-2.1 relies on the WirePlumber 0.5.x API.
